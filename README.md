# read-me-generator

Installations: npm Inquirer, npm axios, node.js

The read me generator is an app that uses node to generate a read me for a project. It uses inquirer to prompt the user a series of questions and then uses axios to grab that users profile picture and email from their github. This project was built to help create a familiarity with node. This assignment helped me understand much of what we went over in class but I'll still probably need more practice with it.
